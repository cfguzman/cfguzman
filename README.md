#  Welcome :wave:

I am an [Associate Professor at the Civil Engineering Department](https://obrasciviles.usach.cl/carlos-felipe/) of the University of Santiago (USACH), Chile. My research interest are mostly related with numerical and experimental characterization of non-linear phenomena in structural materials and geomaterials.

This page mainly contains private repositories for my students' work. However, I will also share some of my own personal projects that I've developed over the years. Most of our programming output ends up in the [MASTER group](https://github.com/MASTER-OOCC "MASTER") repositories.


## Current topics

I am currently working in the following topics:

- Constitutive modeling of the wood cell wall
- Numerical simulation of timber connectors
- Characterization of the quasi-brittle behavior of timber and concrete
- Homogenization-based multiscale techniques
- Damage characterization in copper

I recently received a Fondecyt Regular NÂº1240989 grant from the Chilean National Agency of Research and Development (ANID). The project, entitled *Hysteresis in Timber: A Study from Microscale Rheology to Material Applications*, lasts for 4 years with funding of approximately USD ~$50k per year.

 
## Software and programming

Our work is mostly developed in:

- Matlab, Python and Fortran.
- [Ansys Mechanical APDL](https://www.ansys.com/blog/what-is-apdl "Ansys.com") scripting.
- [FEniCS and FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/ "FEniCS project").


## Contact me

I am keen on collaborative work and I follow the [Open Science](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/ "FOSTER") ethics :blush:
